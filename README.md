# AndroidPropertyManagement
Property management android application 

Developed an Android app to facilitate property management for landlords using Firebase. The app allows landlords to post, edit, and delete property listings, which are displayed in a RecyclerView. These listings are seamlessly shared with renters via a common Firebase database, ensuring efficient and real-time property management. Firebase Authentication is used for secure user login and management.
